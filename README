You are interested in building a model that will predict housing values in Boston suburbs using various predictor variables that you have available. This is your data set: boston.csvPreview the document (the number of attributes has been reduced from the original form)

Use Multiple Linear Regression to build your model, with the median value of owner-occupied homes as the target variable and the rest as predictors.

Determine the significance of these different predictors, and drop the ones that are not useful for your model. Document your work and explain your decision making as you build your model. Report your final model's accuracy.
